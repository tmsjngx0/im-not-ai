# im-not-ai (Humanize KR) — a de-AI-ifier for Korean text

> 한국어 문서: [`README.md`](README.md)

LLMs write Korean that *reads* like translated English. Native speakers spot it instantly, and no amount of prompting ("write naturally in Korean") fixes it — the tells are structural, not stylistic.

**im-not-ai** rewrites AI-written Korean into natural Korean **without changing a single fact** — style, rhythm and phrasing only. MIT licensed, runs as a CLI skill inside Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI and Pi.

```
"AI 기술을 통해 효율을 높일 수 있다"      →  "AI로 효율을 높인다"
"이에 있어서 중요한 점은"                 →  "여기서 중요한 건"
"~에 의해 생성된"                         →  "~가 만든"
"결론적으로, 이는 시사하는 바가 크다"      →  (deleted)
```

## Why a Korean-specific tool

English humanizers (QuillBot, Undetectable AI, Hix) are weak on Korean because the giveaway isn't word choice — it's **translationese**: English syntax wearing Korean morphology. Double passives, `~를 통해` for every English "through/via", left-branching relative clauses imported from English, compulsive third-person pronouns (Korean normally drops them), mechanical "first / second / third" scaffolding, and a closing paragraph that always "carries significant implications."

We catalogued these as **10 categories × 70 sub-patterns**, each with a severity (S1 decisive / S2 strong / S3 weak) and a prescription, grounded in Korean translation-studies literature (KatFish, post-editese metrics, Wendler et al. ACL'24, Lost in Literalism ACL'25).

| ID | Category | Example tells |
|----|----------|---------------|
| A | Translationese | `~를 통해`, `~에 있어서`, double passive `~되어진다`, forced `그/그녀`, left-branching relative clauses |
| B | English over-quoting | Excessive parenthetical glosses, untranslated loanwords |
| C | Structural AI patterns | Mechanical 첫째/둘째/셋째, bullet & emoji overload, comma after connective endings |
| D | AI stock phrases | "결론적으로", "시사하는 바가 크다", "주목할 만하다", "혁신적인" |
| E | Rhythm uniformity | Low sentence-length variance, repeated sentence endings, honorific drift |
| F | Modifier redundancy | "매우/정말", synonym doubling, `~적/~성/~화` inflation |
| G | Hedging pile-up | "~할 수 있을 것으로 보인다" stacked hedges |
| H | Connective spam | Sentence-initial 또한/따라서/즉 in sequence |
| I | Dummy nouns | "것이다", "점", "수", "바", "~할 필요가 있다" |
| J | Visual decoration | Bold, quote marks and em-dash overuse |

## Four hard rules

1. **Meaning is immutable** — facts, claims, numbers, proper nouns and direct quotes survive verbatim.
2. **Evidence-based edits** — only detected spans are touched; undetected text is left alone.
3. **Genre preserved** — a column doesn't become an essay, a report doesn't become prose poetry.
4. **No over-editing** — a deterministic gate warns above a 30% change rate and hard-stops above 50%.

Explicitly out of scope: numbers, units, dates, proper nouns, quoted speech, statutory text, academic terms of art.

## Architecture — the text decides the cost

A deterministic pre-scoring shim grades the input and emits a `route_hint`. The condition of the text picks the route; the route picks the number of LLM calls. Savings come from **fewer calls**, not from a cheaper model (model choice stays with the user).

| Route | LLM calls | When | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **light** | **1** | Already well-written | Single conservative pass; exits early with "this is already fine" |
| **standard** | **2** | Ordinary AI draft | Diagnose → targeted rewrite (10k chars still fits one call) |
| **heavy** | **3+** | Dense AI slop, >15,000 chars, or audit trail required | Diagnose → rewrite (chunked only if needed) → finalize against the source |

```
input
  ↓ prepare_monolith_input.py     quantitative pre-score + route_hint
  ├─ light    → monolith ×1                                → final.md
  ├─ standard → diagnostician → targeted monolith          → final.md
  └─ heavy    → diagnostician → monolith → finalizer       → final.md
  ↓ verify_change_rate.py         deterministic gate (exit code), all routes
```

Measured: running a 10,000-character piece as 7 chunked calls cost 610K tokens; the same piece in a single call cost 134K at equal quality — reloading the rulebook per chunk eats the savings. Hence single-call-first.

## Install

**Claude Code** (plugin marketplace, no clone):

```
/plugin marketplace add epoko77-ai/im-not-ai
/plugin install humanize-korean@im-not-ai
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI**:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add epoko77-ai/im-not-ai
copilot plugin install humanize-korean@im-not-ai
```

**Claude Code / Codex CLI** (clone + script):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epoko77-ai/im-not-ai.git
cd im-not-ai && ./install.sh
```

**Pi** (single-call git package):

```bash
pi install git:github.com/epoko77-ai/im-not-ai
```

Install the optional multi-call prerequisite first:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents
```

In a new Pi session, use `/skill:humanize-korean`, `/humanize`, `/humanize-redo`, or ask in plain language. Pi provides light (1 call), standard (2 calls), and heavy (3+ calls) routes without pinning a model. Heavy chunk processing is capped at four concurrent chunks. Full guide: [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

## Ethics

This is a **Korean writing-quality tool**, not an "AI detector bypass." It is not a guarantee of academic or journalistic integrity, and it will not launder a text's provenance — it only removes the syntactic residue of English-shaped generation. The taxonomy is free to reuse for research, teaching and tool integration under MIT.
